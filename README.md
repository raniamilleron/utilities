# Utilities Repository

# Description
This repository contains general-purpose scripts that I use in bioinformatics projects.
These scripts handle various tasks such as data cleaning and manipulation.
The main focus is to practice writing efficient Bash scripts to automate bioinformatics tasks.

## Learning Goals
- Improve my ability to write Bash scripts for handling large datasets.
- Automate common tasks such as cleaning sequence data.

## Files
- `data_cleaning.sh`: A script that cleans and formats raw bioinformatics data.
  
## Usage
To run the `data_cleaning.sh` script:
```bash
bash data_cleaning.sh
